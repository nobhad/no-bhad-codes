# API Documentation Index

Full API reference is in [`/docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`](../API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Authentication

The API uses HttpOnly JWT cookies for authentication.

- Cookies are set automatically on login; all requests must include `credentials: 'include'`
- `getAuthToken()` always returns `null` — token access from JavaScript is intentionally blocked (HttpOnly)
- Bearer token header is supported as a fallback for API clients that cannot use cookies
- Admin tokens expire in 1 hour; client tokens expire in 7 days

See the [Authentication section](../API_DOCUMENTATION.md#authentication) in the full reference for cookie
properties and the JWT payload structure.
