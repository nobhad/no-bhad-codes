## Production 502 — Schema-Drift Boot Crash

**Status:** Code fix committed (`4c114a3c`) — prod recovery steps still pending
**Priority:** Critical

### What happened

`www.nobhad.codes/api/*` returned 502 ("Application failed to respond"). The
Vercel frontend proxies `/api/*` to the Railway service `no-bhad-codes-production`,
and that service was hard-down — `/health/live`, `/api/*`, and `/` all 502'd.
Railway build succeeded but the healthcheck never passed, so the container was
killed and retried until it gave up.

### Root cause

Boot sequence runs migrations, then schema-drift detection that throws in
production on any mismatch with the recorded baseline (`server/app.ts`).
Migration 139 (`drop projects.intake_id`) legitimately changed the `projects`
table, but the drift baseline still held the pre-139 schema. The guard flagged
the migration's own change as drift and threw **before** reaching
`recordSchemaBaseline` — so the baseline never updated and every boot
re-crashed. A permanent crash loop. Confirmed in the Railway runtime log:
`Failed to start server: Error: Schema drift detected (... modified=1) at startServer (server/app.ts:560)`.

This was a latent landmine: every schema-changing migration would brick prod the
same way.

### Fix (in code)

- [x] `server/app.ts`: track whether THIS boot applied migrations; if so,
  rebaseline to the post-migration schema instead of throwing. Out-of-band drift
  (schema changed with no migration to explain it) still fails loud. Commit
  `4c114a3c`.

### Prod recovery (Noelle, Railway CLI) — pending

The committed fix prevents recurrence but does NOT clear the existing stale
baseline (a normal boot has no pending migrations, so the old baseline still
trips the guard). Clear it once with the escape hatch:

- [ ] `railway variables --set "ACCEPT_SCHEMA_DRIFT=true"`
- [ ] `railway up` (ships the fix from the working dir) — wait for build + boot
- [ ] Confirm 200: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://no-bhad-codes-production.up.railway.app/health/live`
- [ ] `railway variables --set "ACCEPT_SCHEMA_DRIFT=false"`
- [ ] `railway redeploy --yes` — should boot clean with drift protection restored

### Loose ends

- [ ] `git push` — local `main` is ahead with `4c114a3c` (drift fix) and
  `8cf6a037` (contact arrow). `railway up` deploys the working dir directly,
  bypassing git, so the repo must be pushed to match what's live.

## Portal Streamline + Hedgewitch Invite-Prep

**Status:** SHIPPED, awaiting spot-check + one-time Drive setup

### Done in code (2026-05-01)

- [x] Nav streamline: `hideInSolo` flag + `PORTAL_MODE` env in `unified-navigation.ts`. Tagged `requests-hub` (client), `analytics`, `support` (admin), and subtabs `leads`, `contacts`, `ad-hoc-requests`, `document-requests`, `questionnaires`. Default mode is `solo` — items reappear when `PORTAL_MODE=multi`.
- [x] Migration 138: replaced 10 stale generic checklist steps on Hedgewitch's checklist (id=1) with the curated 12 pre-launch deliverables. Backup at `data/backups/pre-migration/client_portal_pre-migrate_*.db` and `data/client_portal.db.bak.before138`.
- [x] Pre-migration backup hook in `scripts/migrate.ts` — every `npm run migrate` snapshots to `data/backups/pre-migration/` first.
- [x] Off-server backup service at `server/services/drive-backup-service.ts` + CLI `npm run backup:drive`. Wired into nightly scheduler in `scheduler-service.ts` — no-op when env vars unset.
- [x] OPS_RUNBOOK updated with pre-migration backup + Google Drive offsite setup steps.
- [x] Memory file updated: Hedgewitch portal IDs (client_id=6, project_id=7, checklist_id=1), bios-done state, and "no public street address on the site" preference.

### Spot-check (Noelle, local)

- [ ] `npm run dev:full`
- [ ] Admin login — sidebar lost `Analytics` and `Knowledge`; CRM/Work/Documents subtabs trimmed
- [ ] Client view (impersonate Hedgewitch or temp account) — sidebar lost `Requests`; dashboard onboarding card shows the new 12 items; pending invoice surfaces in `ActionItems` with red alert variant
- [ ] If anything looks wrong: `cp data/client_portal.db.bak.before138 data/client_portal.db` to restore

### Google Drive offsite-backup setup (one-time, ~5 min)

- [ ] Google Cloud Console → enable **Google Drive API** in a project
- [ ] IAM → Service Accounts → create + download JSON key
- [ ] Drive → create a backup folder → share Editor permission with the service account's `client_email`
- [ ] Set Railway env vars:
  - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` = JSON `client_email`
  - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` = JSON `private_key`
  - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` = ID from the folder's share URL
- [ ] Local sanity test: `npm run db:backup && npm run backup:drive` — file lands in Drive
- [ ] Confirm production: tail Railway logs for `DB backup uploaded to Drive` after 03:30 UTC

### Then send the actual invite

- [ ] Send invite email to `offerings@hedgewitchhorticulture.com` (Emily & Abby) from admin → Clients → Hedgewitch
- [ ] Confirm invite arrives + magic link opens the portal
- [ ] Walk the portal cold as them once before they get to it; fix anything jarring

### Deferred / nice-to-have (not blocking)

- [ ] Category headers on the OnboardingCard (Approvals / Team / Imagery / Business). Currently the 12 items render as a flat ordered list. Requires a `category` column migration + small `OnboardingCard.tsx` change.
- [ ] Pre-filtered deep links from each upload row to the right Files folder (e.g., `?folder=headshots`). Today they land on Files generically.
- [ ] Verify the `data/backups/weekly/` directory is empty by design or the Sunday-weekly path in `scripts/backup-database.ts` isn't firing — pick a behavior.
- [ ] Drop the `LocalBusiness` schema street-address field on the Hedgewitch Astro site (locality-only Fitchburg, MA).

## Main Site Navigation Direction

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

- [x] **Horizontal scroll-map nav model — SHIPPED.** Pages on a 2D map (intro centre, about up, projects right, contact down); scroll / two-finger swipe / arrow keys pan the camera with slide transitions, nav-menu + direct hash links use the blur crossfade, paw stays sovereign for intro entry. Carousel order: intro ↔ about ↔ projects ↔ contact. **Final input model (2026-06-25):** vertical OR horizontal scroll navigates on intro/about/contact; projects vertical = channel-surf (leave via horizontal swipe or Shift+wheel); Shift+wheel = mouse-wheel parity; project-detail vertical native-scrolls then navigates at the edge, left/right cycles projects; projects→detail slides DOWN. Full matrix in `docs/design/MAIN_SITE_DESIGN.md` › Page Transitions.
- [x] **Reincorporate tech-stack content** — direction locked: chunked GSAP "title-card runway" animation that fires during horizontal scroll-map transitions. Data shipped 2026-04-30: `Profile.techStack` is now a `TechStackChunk[]` (4 chunks of 8) in `public/data/portfolio.json:434-499`, type at `src/services/data-service.ts:42-58`. Chunks keyed to actual horizontal edges of the scroll-map: `intro-about` (Languages & Frameworks), `about-projects` (Styling, UI & Motion), `projects-contact` (Backend & Data), `contact-intro` (Tooling, Testing & Ship). Original 43-item marquee list reconciled against 2026-04-30 deps audit: 10 stale items dropped (PHP, Vue, jQuery, Bootstrap, Vuetify, Handlebars, MongoDB, MySQL, Mongoose, Jotai); 12 added (Astro, Three.js, OpenType.js, Lucide, Radix UI, Chart.js, Multer, Vercel, Netlify, Anthropic SDK, Stripe, Zod). Final count: 32 items.
- [ ] **Implement tech-stack runway animation** — GSAP timeline on horizontal map→map transitions. Single integration point: `src/modules/animation/page-transition.ts:1985` inside the bridge-slide block (every horizontal map slide flows through there). Touch list:
  - Create `src/modules/animation/tech-stack-runway.ts` (singleton, exposes `play(opts)` returning timeline promise; owns reverse/interrupt logic via `currentTimeline.reverse()` for inverse direction, `kill()` otherwise).
  - Create `src/styles/components/tech-stack-runway.css` (overlay scaffolding only — `position: fixed; inset: 0; pointer-events: none`; structural sizing, will-change, mobile hide via `@media (max-width: 767px)`; all motion is GSAP).
  - Modify `src/modules/animation/page-transition.ts` — single `await TechStackRunway.play({ fromId, toId, direction, sourceEl, targetEl })` between line 1985 and 2011, guarded by `isHorizontal && fromIsMap && toIsMap && !this.reducedMotion`.
  - Modify `src/styles/bundles/site.css` — one `@import "../components/tech-stack-runway.css" layer(states);` between lines 70–71.
  - Inject overlay markup via JS on first `play()` (vanilla TS, not React): `<div class="tech-runway"><div class="tech-runway__heading"><span class="tech-runway__heading-text"></span></div><ul class="tech-runway__items"><li>×8</li></ul></div>` appended to `#main-content`.
  - **Timeline envelope: ~1.0s** total (`PAGE_ANIMATION.SLIDE_DURATION` is 0.55s, so first 0.55s races camera, trailing 0.45s settles+clears on destination):
    - 0.00s — heading enters from leading edge oversized (`clamp(8rem, 16vw, 20rem)`, Acme, 900 weight, condensed), `xPercent: dir*-120 → 0`, `scaleX: 0.7 → 1`, blur 8 → 0, duration 0.18s, `power3.out`.
    - 0.26s — heading explodes/fades: `xPercent: dir*30`, `scaleX: 1.4`, opacity → 0, blur → 12, duration 0.16s, `power2.in`.
    - 0.16s — items fly in (slight overlap with heading-out), `xPercent: dir*-160 → 0`, `stagger: { each: 0.035, from: dir > 0 ? 'start' : 'end' }`, duration 0.42s.
    - ~0.60s — items decelerate to thin ticker on destination's leading margin: `scale: 0.55, y: '38vh'`, duration 0.18s, `power2.out`.
    - ~0.83s — fade overlay `opacity: 0`, duration 0.20s.
  - Data wiring: `dataService.getProfile().techStack`, lookup chunk by sorted tile-pair key (`[fromId, toId].sort().join('|')`).
  - Open risks: (1) z-index — runway must sit at `--z-index-overlay` *below* `#intro-morph-overlay` so the paw isn't covered (verify in `intro-morph.css`); (2) Acme font preload check in `templates/partials/head.ejs` to avoid FOUT on the oversized heading; (3) reverse during heading-explode window (~0.26s–0.42s) looks weird in v1 — accept as known trade-off, future polish via timeline labels.
  - v1 scope: horizontal only. Vertical (`intro↔hero`, `intro↔contact` with `hero` as a separate up-arm) deferred — same pattern with axis swap.
- [x] **Pike portfolio entry — WON'T DO** (decided 2026-06-12). Not adding Pike Powder Coating to the portfolio. The project still lives at `/Users/noellebhaduri/Projects/Development/Active/pike` (5,607 LOC, designed + built, client opted not to launch) with its design docs, but it's not going on the No Bhad Codes site.

## TV Channel System (Projects Page)

**Status:** SHIPPED v1 — outstanding polish + features below

The projects page renders a vintage TV with a channel-guide screen. Channel 01 is the guide itself; channels 02+ are individual project tune-ins. Selecting (Enter / click / wheel-cycle to a project channel) plays a static burst, fades the composed title card in, fades to the bg-only image, then auto-cycles through case-study panels (Details → Tagline → Intro → Challenge → Approach → Key Features → Results → Tools → Outro). Outro panel sticks with a click-through link to the existing project-detail page.

### Open Mobile Bugs (paused at end of day, pick up next session)

- [x] **Business card hovers over every section after navigating left/right through all pages the first time.** Root cause: `restoreIntroCardState()` in `page-transition.ts:431` was setting inline `visibility: visible` on `#svg-business-card` — an SVG that lives inside the body-level fixed `#intro-morph-overlay`. CSS spec: a child's `visibility: visible` overrides a parent's `visibility: hidden`, so even though `hideMorphOverlay()` kept hiding the overlay container, the card child painted through it on every subsequent tile. Bug was dormant until the user navigated *back* to intro at least once (which is when `restoreIntroCardState` runs), then *away* again — matching the "after first scroll through" repro. Three secondary leaks fixed alongside: (a) mobile `completeMorphAnimation` now clears the inline `display: flex`/`opacity: 1` it set at intro start (was leaving the hide resting on a single inline `visibility: hidden`); (b) desktop `playEntryAnimation` now re-adds `intro-complete`/`intro-finished` at completion (was stripping them at start, never restoring — so the `.intro-complete .intro-morph-overlay` hide rule stopped applying after a back-to-intro paw entry); (c) the mobile media query in `intro-morph.css` now scopes its `display:flex; opacity:1; visibility:visible` re-assertion to `html.intro-loading` (was unconditional, would override any post-completion hide). Files: `page-transition.ts`, `intro-animation.ts`, `intro-animation-mobile.ts`, `components/intro-morph.css`.
- [x] **TV not horizontally centered on mobile.** Root cause: `.crt-tv` width was `min(1240px, …, 98vw)`. On mobile `98vw` evaluated wider than the wrap's content box (`.projects-tv-wrap` had horizontal padding), so the TV overflowed under flex centering and read as right-shifted. Fix: dropped the `98vw` cap from the base rule (now relies on `max-width: 100%` to fit the wrap's content box) and zeroed the wrap's horizontal padding on mobile. Removed all `!important` overrides.
- [x] **Channel rows still showing on mobile** — obsoleted by redesign. Mobile guide now intentionally shows the rows (with smaller typography) alongside the new `.crt-tv__guide-top` brand pane; the old hide rule was removed.
- [x] **Contact page bg + avatar missing on mobile.** Two root causes fixed: (1) `.contact-section` mobile rule had `background-color: var(--color-neutral-300)` which painted over `body::before` (the parchment overlay) — removed it. (2) The `--laptop-wide` (max-width: 1100px) rule on `.contact-bg-avatar` set `opacity: 0.06`, which also matched on mobile and multiplied with the inner SVG part opacities (`#MAIN/#NOSE/#EAR` at 0.12, `#EYE` at 0.5) down to ~0.007 effective — invisible. Mobile rule now explicitly resets `opacity: 1` so the inner-path opacities control the watermark fade as designed.

### Outstanding TODOs

- [x] **Wire up the TV's physical buttons** — POWER toggles screen on/off; CHANNEL ▲▼ cycles channels mirroring wheel/arrow keys; VOLUME ▲▼ wired to tv-sfx (5-step volume, persisted to localStorage).
- [x] **Re-export TV assets at 1426×1093** — all per-project bgs, composed title cards, channel digit overlays, and title-card base now exported at full TV-frame canvas with hyphenated filenames. Stacks at `inset:0; width/height:100%`, no centering math. Old underscored set deleted.
- [ ] **Re-align the base screen artwork** — base bbox `(100, 95, 1137, 864)` is ~6px wider on each side than the per-project cards `(106, 95, 1131, 864)`. Causes a small visible jump when cycling between channel 01 and 02+. Re-export from the same artboard origin as the project cards so artwork lands at x:106-1131. NOTE: the old `title-card_base.webp` no longer exists — the base screen now lives as `public/images/tv/base-on.webp` / `base-off.webp` (introduced 2026-04-30, `76f66a37`); re-export targets those two files.
- [x] **Update "No Bhad Codes" case study copy** — keyFeature `"CRT TV hover preview"` replaced, scroll-map + TV channel guide added, approach paragraph rewritten to mention signature features.
- [x] **Verify Hedgewitch and The Backend case studies** — Backend feature claims verified against actual code (`013_magic_link.sql`, `message-service.ts`, Chart.js, node-cron, etc.). Hedgewitch is a separate project — copy reads accurately.
- [x] **TV channel copy condensed** — added `tv` namespace per project. TV reads from `tv.X ?? X`. All three documented projects have curated TV copy.
- [x] **Trace root cause of arrow-key native page scroll** — `page-transition.ts:handleKeydown` only called `preventDefault` after navigation gates (`isTransitioning`, `!introComplete`, `canNavigate`); during those windows the browser native-scrolled. Fix: moved `preventDefault` before the gates so any arrow key on a managed page is unconditionally swallowed (form inputs still opt out). Backup window-listener in `projects.ts` and the `isOnProjectsPage()` helper that supported it have been removed.
- [x] **Channel-change static crackle + channel-up beep** — implemented as `src/modules/audio/tv-sfx.ts` (procedural WebAudio synthesis, no asset files). Static = filtered white-noise burst, beep = 880Hz sine. Master gain via 5-step volume tied to VOLUME ▲▼ buttons.
- [x] **Mobile TV** — TV is fully responsive at all widths; channel-rows visible with smaller typography, button hit area extended, full-width on phones. No mobile fallback needed.
- [x] **Channel 01 redesigned as Prevue Guide layout** — top split (brand info + glowing-eye avatar with inlined eye-glow filter); bottom slow ticker of project rows (rendered twice, GSAP translates the inner ul up at ~16 px/sec for a seamless loop).
- [x] **Documentation: refreshed `MAIN_SITE_DESIGN.md`** (2026-06-25) — rewrote Page Transitions (scroll-map + input matrix + slide directions), added a Contact Form section (placeholders-as-labels + CSRF), updated the Page Architecture mobile section and the contact-animation module descriptions (here + `ANIMATIONS.md`).

### Recent shipped (this session)

- Vintage TV frame with transparent screen aperture (replaces previous CRT)
- Per-project background images and structured `titleCard` data in portfolio.json
- Title card composed → bg crossfade animation
- Per-panel fade cycle with heading-flash treatment for "The Challenge" / "The Approach"
- LED channel display overlay (channel_01.webp ... channel_10.webp) syncs with active channel
- Channel-list in 4-column grid with category subtitles, "01 PROJECTS" highlighted by default
- Per-card text colors (true black or true white) drive panel typography
- Theme-independent TV interior (hardcoded #fff / #1a1a1a, no light/dark flipping)
- Per-panel hold timing map (paragraphs 9s, lists 7s, tagline 4s, etc.)
- Esc cancels active tune-in; click-through link in outro panel preserves detail-page navigation
- First-person voice in approach sections; "magic links" parenthetical stripped from TV render only

## Session 2026-06-12 — Mobile / Contact / Intro / Audio fixes

**Status:** SHIPPED (committed; two items await on-device confirmation)

### Shipped

- **Contact form placeholders visible** (`89364621`) — labels are `display:none` by design (the placeholders ARE the field names), but `--placeholder-opacity` defaulted to `0` from a removed fade-in animation, so desktop rendered empty field boxes. Defaulted to `1` in `src/styles/pages/contact.css` (mobile was already patched).
- **Intro paw-morph NaN guard** (`89364621`) — `calculateSvgAlignment` divided `0/0` when the card/overlay measured 0 (deep-load to a non-intro page, or the collapsed small-mobile layout), writing `transform="translate(NaN, NaN)"` and throwing on navigation. Both morph builders in `intro-animation.ts` now skip the morph when alignment isn't finite. Verified 0 console errors, desktop + mobile.
- **TV ticker on mobile + centering** (`5030e1b1`) — lifted the `<=479px` ticker guard and restart it from a `ResizeObserver` on the guide viewport (fires once the TV lays out from 0 height). Chevrons moved to a SIBLING of the TV wrap so the `translate(-50%,-50%)` centering no longer drags them off-screen.
- **Small-mobile pivot + iOS overscroll + TV audio isolation** (`7a2b23ff`) — landed the discrete-tile small-mobile architecture; `overscroll-behavior: contain` on the tile scroller + `none` on `html`/`body` to stop iOS rubber-banding the fixed header; and `transitionTo` now syncs `currentPageId` in its `catch` so a thrown animation can't leave it stale on the source page.

### Awaiting on-device confirmation

- [ ] **Off-page channel cycling / audio bleed** — root cause: stale `currentPageId` from a thrown transition animation let the wheel cycle TV channels (and restart channel music) on other pages. Fixed in `7a2b23ff`. Confirm on device: trackpad on contact should NOT change channels or start music. If it recurs, check console for `[PageTransitionModule] Transition failed:` — present means the fix is firing, absent means a second desync path remains.
- [ ] **iOS overscroll** — confirm the fixed header no longer rubber-bands on a real iPhone.

---

## Session 2026-06-25 — Scroll/nav model + contact form

### Shipped

- **Contact form submits again** (`c2c95cfc`) — was failing with `403 CSRF_TOKEN_INVALID`. `ContactService.submitToCustom` never sent the `x-csrf-token` header, and on a cold visit the `csrf-token` cookie isn't set yet. Now sends the header (shared `getCsrfToken`) with `credentials:'include'` and primes the cookie via `GET /api/health` first. Verified end-to-end without sending a real email.
- **Scroll/nav model finalised** (`0366358b`, `13b295e9`, `21c53175`) — vertical OR horizontal scroll navigates the carousel on intro/about/contact; projects vertical = channel-surf; `Shift+wheel` = mouse-wheel parity (reads whichever axis the browser populates); project-detail vertical scrolls then navigates at the edge, left/right cycles projects. (Went back and forth on this — current state is "any scroll navigates except projects = channel".)
- **projects → project-detail slides DOWN** (`13b295e9`) — TV scrolls up and out, detail pushes up from the bottom (was sliding in from the right). Detail↔detail left/right carousel unchanged.
- **Click a playing TV screen → project detail** (`16476f9b`) — same tab, instead of the live link opening a new tab. The explicit "Live: url" link still opens the live site.

### Awaiting on-device confirmation (real mouse)

- [ ] **Shift+wheel direction feel** — uses the app's natural-scroll sign convention; if Shift+wheel-up goes the "wrong way" on a physical mouse, it's a one-line sign flip.

---

## PDF Deep Dive

**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE

- [x] Label bolding — parseInlineBold() + drawInlineBoldText() in markdown-to-pdf.ts
- [x] SOW header — removed unused `sowLogoHeight: 50` constant, all generators use standard 100pt
- [x] Margin alignment — markdown-to-pdf.ts margins updated from 45pt to 54pt (matches all other generators)
- [ ] Full formatting review (spacing, table layouts, typography consistency across all 6 PDF types)

---

## Portfolio Capture Script

**Status:** MOSTLY WORKING — one fix awaiting verification

`scripts/capture-portfolio.ts` (renamed from `take-screenshots.ts`) captures public + authenticated screenshots and video walkthroughs of the site. Reads creds from `.env` (`ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` for admin, `PORTAL_EMAIL`/`PORTAL_PASSWORD` for client). Modes: `--screenshots`, `--video`, `--all` (default).

### Done

- [x] Renamed `take-screenshots.ts` → `capture-portfolio.ts`
- [x] CLI mode flags (`--screenshots` / `--video` / `--all`)
- [x] Unified login flow via `/#/portal` dropdown (`POST /api/auth/portal-login`); single helper `loginAs(email, password)` works for both roles
- [x] Auth page paths corrected to `/dashboard#/<tab>` for both roles
- [x] Login-once-per-role refactor: one login per role per run, browser context reused across all viewport+theme captures (was 8/role → caused rate-limit 429s and broke mobile login because `#portal-trigger` is hidden behind hamburger on mobile)
- [x] Login always runs at desktop viewport before resizing — mobile auth now works
- [x] `PORTAL_EMAIL` / `PORTAL_PASSWORD` placeholder keys added to `.env.example`; real values in local `.env` (gitignored)

### Open

- [ ] **Verify `setTheme` localStorage try/catch fix** — client video walkthroughs were dropping pages mid-sequence with `SecurityError: Failed to read the 'localStorage' property from 'Window'` during transitional/sandboxed states. Wrapped `localStorage.setItem` in try/catch (`scripts/capture-portfolio.ts:104`); `data-theme` attribute alone drives theming. Re-run `npx tsx scripts/capture-portfolio.ts --video` and confirm no SecurityErrors in client walkthroughs.
- [ ] **Rotate the two account passwords that were pasted in chat on 2026-04-30** — admin `nobhaduri@gmail.com` and client `nmbhaduri@gmail.com`. After rotating, update `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `PORTAL_PASSWORD` in local `.env`. Reminder routine `trig_014SxD3PRfVZcZUGwfA7Kz8y` fires 2026-05-01 at 9 PM EDT.

### Notes

- Auth API rate limit (`createRateLimiter` in `server/middleware/rate-limiter.ts`) is in-memory; restarting `npm run dev:full` clears any 429 block.
- `/dashboard#/invoices` redirects to `/dashboard#/documents` on the client side — captured filename still says `portal-invoices`.
